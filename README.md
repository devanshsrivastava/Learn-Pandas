## What is Pandas

Pandas is a Python package that provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language. It is already well on its way towards this goal.

##How to Install

Binary installers for the latest released version are available at the Python package index and on conda.

# conda
> conda install pandas
# or PyPI
> pip install pandas

Pandas is very easy to use and can handle large datasets more efficiently than excel.
We will be covering other libraries and Machine Learning Models used to process,analyse and predict data later.
